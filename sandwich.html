		<p>I'm going to integrate a URX Carousel to listen to and watch The Boss. And then add a button to buy tickets.</p>
		<p>Afterwards I'm going to upload pictures of my family and add the abiliy to add to a Pinterest board.</p>
		<p>Then, I'm goint to add some schema.org tags so when I Tweet my picture out it will look fantastic.</p>
		<p>Lastly, I want to host my code somewhere so I'm not using the Google drive hack solution.</p>
		<p>I also opened a Code Academy account to help me style the page and learn other things as I have time.</p>
		<p>Thanks in advance to my techncial friends for support :)</p>
